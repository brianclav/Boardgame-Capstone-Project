This is a Capstone project which uses Google Colab to display board game data and uses sklearn's Random Forest Regressor model to make 
board game complexity and overall rating predictions.

User Guide
1.	If you are not already signed into Google Colab, sign in with your google account.
2.	Open BoardgameApp.ipynb
3.	Select “Runtime” and then “Run all”.
4.	A warning box will appear. This application does not request access to your data stored with Google, nor does it read data and 
    credentials from other sessions. The code may be previewed to confirm this. When you are satisfied that the application is safe, 
    select “Run anyway”.
5.	The application will take roughly 90 seconds to compile.  You will know this process is complete when, at the bottom center of the 
    browser window, you see a green checkmark followed by a “0s” and the completion time.
6.	Follow the instructions in the application. Each section may be scrolled to and interacted with.
